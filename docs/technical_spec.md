# Technical Specification: Enhanced LDA for Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This document describes the technical implementation of our enhanced LDA framework for customer sentiment analysis.

## Architecture
The system consists of three main components:
1. **Backend API**: Flask-based server implementing the enhanced LDA algorithm
2. **Frontend Interface**: React-based web application for user interaction
3. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Text preprocessing and model evaluation components

## Enhanced LDA Algorithm
### Key Enhancements
1. **Gibbs Sampling Implementation**:
   - Uses MCMC for more accurate topic assignment
   - Parallel processing with Gensim's LdaMulticore

2. **Perplexity Optimization**:
   - Iterative refinement of hyperparameters
   - Automated evaluation of model quality

3. **Topic Coherence Metrics**:
   - 'c_v' coherence measure from Gensim
   - Additional custom metrics for sentiment alignment

### Data Flow
1. User uploads customer reviews (CSV, JSON, or TXT)
2. Backend preprocesses text (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization)
3. Enhanced LDA model processes the text
4. Results are evaluated for coherence and quality
5. Frontend visualizes topics and sentiment patterns

## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/upload`: Process uploaded file
- `POST /api/analyze`: Analyze direct text input
- Returns JSON with topics, coherence scores, and visualizations

## Dependencies
- Python: Gensim, SpaCy, NLTK, Flask
- JavaScript: React, Chart.js, Axios
